Engineering Tasks:
* Basic DOM test

To Do on current task:
- Make Jake success more obvious
- Make test look at karma DOM

Future ideas:
- Create 'fail fast' assertion code
- Abstract test framework? (Swap out a different framework to make sure abstraction works)
- Static checking of function parameters (rather than writing tests)
- Handle errors properly in server.js
- server.stop() waits for open connections to close (e.g., Firefox keeps open connection).
  Make it forcibly close?
- Remove Node version duplication between package.json and Jakefile.js
- Fix httpGet duplication
- Automate npm rebuild (Remove node_modules .bin directory from repository (and add to .gitignore) and 'npm rebuild' in jake
- Ensure that every browser has same number of tests running

Notes:
- Nodeunit doesn't work properly on Windows.
