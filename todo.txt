WeeWikiPaint

Minimum Marketing Feature:
* single-user painting on home page
- collaborative painting
- wiki-fy the pages
- more complex painting
- more collaborative features

User stories:
* Create empty drawing area
- Draw one line

Engineering Tasks:
* Set up client-side testing
- Test drawing tool (Raphael?)
- Integrate into HTML page

To Do on current task:
- run karma from jake script
- set up client side linting options
- Automatically check that we are testing against all supported browsers.
- Move karma.conf.js to a better location
- Unify our test file location configuration (it's currently split between Jakefile & karma.conf.js)

Future ideas:
- Create 'fail fast' assertion code
- Abstract test framework? (Swap out a different framework to make sure abstraction works)
- Static checking of function parameters (rather than writing tests)
- Handle errors properly in server.js
- server.stop() waits for open connections to close (e.g., Firefox keeps open connection).
  Make it forcibly close?
- Remove Node version duplication between package.json and Jakefile.js
- Fix httpGet duplication

Notes:
- Nodeunit doesn't work properly on Windows.
